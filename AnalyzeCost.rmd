#analys of cost breakdown

```{r, results='hide'}
library("xtable")
source ("LoadData.R")
source ("AnalyzeGroups.R")
```

First question...how do breakdowns compare to the total

```{r,reasis}
si= which (names(lps)=="HH_Illness_1_National_Hospital_cost_Medicine")
ei= which (names(lps)=="HH_Illness_1_National_Hospital_cost_Others")
sumCosts<-rowSums (lps[,si:ei],na.rm = TRUE);
diffCosts <- sumCosts - lps$HH_Illness_1_National_Hospital_cost_Overall_average;
 sum (sumCosts == lps$HH_Illness_1_National_Hospital_cost_Overall_average,na.rm = TRUE)
hist(diffCosts)

sum(!is.na(lps$HH_Illness_1_Consult_National_Hospital))

```

```{r, results='asis'}
print(xtable(payTable),"html")

print(xtable(payTableSPSS),"html")
```
sum(lps)
