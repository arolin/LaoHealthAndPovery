```{r}
  HEFCard <-!is.na(lps$"q1_8_6");
  AllPoor <-!is.na(lps$"q1_8_7");
  sum(HEFCard)  
  sum(AllPoor)

  sum(HEFCard | AllPoor)
  sum(PoorList=="Yes")
  sum(PoorList=="Yes" & !(HEFCard | AllPoor))
  sum((HEFCard | AllPoor) & !(PoorList=="Yes"))
```  
There are ```r sum(PoorList=="Yes" | HEFCard | AllPoor)``` on one poor list or other.

```r  sum(HEFCard)  ``` people are on the HEF list and a seperate ```r  sum(AllPoor & !HEFCard)``` answered yes to being on a govt list.

  ```r sum(HEFCard & AllPoor)``` respondants answered yes to both, and ```r  sum(HEFCard | AllPoor)``` answered yes to either.
  
  Of the ```r  sum(HEFCard | AllPoor)```, ```r sum((HEFCard | AllPoor) & (PoorList=="Yes"))``` are on the vilage poor list.
  There being ```r  sum(PoorList=="Yes")``` on the village poor list, this leaves ```r  sum(PoorList=="Yes" & !(HEFCard | AllPoor))``` on the vilage poor list who neither have a HEF card nor answer yes to being on a govt poor list. Conversly there are ```r  sum(HEFCard  & !(PoorList=="Yes"))``` who have an HEF card and are not on the village poor list and ```r sum(AllPoor  & !(PoorList=="Yes"))``` on a govt poor list but not a village one.

```{r}

VillageOnly = PoorList=="Yes" & !(HEFCard | AllPoor);
HEFOnly     = HEFCard & (!PoorList=="Yes" | AllPoor);
